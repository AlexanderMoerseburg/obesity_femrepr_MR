## Cluster diseases and instrument SNPs by causal effect of obesity on female reproductive diseases

### Files:
To cluster diseases -
1. **disease_clustering.R** - Cluster female reproductive disease outcomes by single-SNP effects of each obesity genetic instrument using UMAP and plot results .
2. **SNP_clustering.R** - Cluster single-SNP MR results for each obesity x female reproductive disease combination to create "causal", "junk", and "null" clusters using mixture model clustering in MRClust and plot heatmaps of causal SNP effect sizes
